# 3D-Phylogenetic-Tree-Visualizer
3D phylogenetic Tree visulizer for virtual reality platforms. Implemented using the Godot game engine.

# World-In-Miniature movement system
This application uses the world-in-miniature movement which was initially implemented by Richard Stoakley and his team in 1995.
This method was chosen because traditional ray-based interaction does not work well for spaces that heavily utilize the 3rd dimension.


# Phylogenetic Trees & Cladograms
Many of these datasets can become very complicated when using only 2 dimensions, adding the extra 3rd dimension gives more freedom to concisely represent these taxonomies in an interactive way.
